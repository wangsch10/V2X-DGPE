# DI-V2X
The official implementation of AAAI2024 paper DI-V2X: Learning Domain-Invariant Representation for Vehicle-Infrastructure Collaborative 3D Object Detection.
[Papaer](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/28105/28215).


# Install
Please follow the feishu docs CoAlign Installation Guide [Chinese Ver.](https://udtkdfu8mk.feishu.cn/docx/LlMpdu3pNoCS94xxhjMcOWIynie) or [English Ver.](https://udtkdfu8mk.feishu.cn/docx/SZNVd0S7UoD6mVxUM6Wc8If6ncc) to learn how to install and run this repo.

Or you can refer to [OpenCOOD data introduction](https://opencood.readthedocs.io/en/latest/md_files/data_intro.html) and [OpenCOOD installation guide](https://opencood.readthedocs.io/en/latest/md_files/installation.html) to prepare data and install CoAlign. The installation is totally the same as OpenCOOD, except some dependent packages required by CoAlign.



# Prepare Dataset
## Dair-V2X
Prepare the dair-v2x dataset following the official guide and then prepare the [complemeted annotations](https://siheng-chen.github.io/dataset/dair-v2x-c-complemented/).

Prepare the domain-mixing instance bank(DMA) following:

```
cd ~/DI-V2X
python opencood/data_utils/datasets/basedataset/dairv2x_basedataset.py
```

- The folder structure shall be like this:
    - cooperative-vehicle-infrastructure
        - cooperative
        - gt_database_fusion
        - infrastructure-side
        - vehilce-side
        - dairv2x_dbinfos_fusion.pkl
        - train.json
        - val.json

## Train
### Step1: Train the teacher with mutiple gpus
```
bash opencood/tools/scripts/dist_train.sh 4 opencood/hypes_yaml/dairv2x/lidar_only/pointpillar_early_gtsample_multiscale.yaml early
```

then the teacher model will be saved in {teacher_model_path}.

### Step2: Train the student
First set parameter of the kd_flag->teacher_path to {teacher_model_path} in the pointpillar_pdd_distillation.yaml.
Then train the model:

```
bash opencood/tools/scripts/train_w_kd.sh opencood/hypes_yaml/dairv2x/lidar_only/pointpillar_pdd_distillation.yaml
```
then the student model will be save in {student_model_path}

## Test
```
python opencood/tools/inference.py --model_dir {student_model_path} --fusion_method intermediate
```

## Checkpoints
The DI-V2X teacher and student models and evaluation files can be found in opencood/logs.
